# Flask API Service Starter

This is a minimal Flask API service starter based on [Google Cloud Run Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy/deploy-python-service).

## Getting Started

Server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, run:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./devserver.sh
```
